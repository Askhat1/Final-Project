# 🚁 Drone Tracking with YOLOv8 + SORT

This project is focused on detecting and tracking drones in videos using a custom-trained YOLOv8 model and the SORT (Simple Online and Realtime Tracking) algorithm.

## 📌 Features

- Real-time drone detection using YOLOv8
- Object tracking with persistent IDs via SORT (Kalman Filter + Hungarian Algorithm)
- Works with video files or live webcam input
- Supports custom training with drone datasets
